**Cluster rules:**
1. No undermeshing or exploiting terrain.
2. No blatant racism. Will be dealt with on a case by case.
3. Stuck or missing dinos are your problem. Stuck players who can\'t suicide or be helped by community will be helped by admins.
4. No abusing the passive protect mod. If you use passive protect dinos to block paths, turret towers or any other access to your base you will be judged...harshly.
5. Only 2 main bases per map per tribe. You can have max 4x4 outposts for farming/taming within reason.
6. No blocking or using turrets at obelisks, wyvern spawns, ragnarok pearl cave or extinction titan terminals!
7. No insiding tribes or betraying alliances. This is a bannable offence!

**Cluster etiquette:**
1. Try not to be a dick.
2. When raiding try to just get in and get the loot. Try to leave the tribe a chance to rebuild. Killing every single dino that is not aggressive or neutral is just being a dick; try to be chill. See #1
3. You see a newbie tribe w a small stone base? Maybe DON\'T wipe them just for shits... See #1
